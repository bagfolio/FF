# Security Fixes Applied - Revela Platform

## Critical Security Issue Fixed

### 1. **Stripe Live Keys Exposure** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Live Stripe secret keys were exposed in `.env.local` which is accessible to the client
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Created secure server-side environment file at `/server/.env`
  - Moved all sensitive credentials (Stripe secret key, webhook secret, database URL, etc.) to server-only file
  - Updated `.env.local` to only contain client-safe configuration (public keys only)
  - Updated server environment loading to prioritize server-specific env files

### 2. **Authentication Button Clarity** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Issue**: "Replit" authentication button text was confusing for users
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Changed button text from "Entrar com sua Conta Replit" to "Continuar com Login Seguro"
  - Added helper text: "Use sua conta existente para acessar a plataforma"
  - Removed specific platform references to reduce confusion

## Environment Variables Structure

### Client-Safe Variables (`.env.local`)
- `NODE_ENV`
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (safe for client)
- `APP_URL`
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`
- Development flags

### Server-Only Variables (`/server/.env`)
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SESSION_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` ⚠️
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` ⚠️
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- All other sensitive credentials

## Dashboard Data Loading Verification ✅
- Confirmed `/api/dashboard/athlete` endpoint uses `Promise.allSettled` for graceful error handling
- All data loading failures are handled without breaking the dashboard
- Profile completion calculation works correctly
- Activity feed properly aggregates data from multiple sources

## Security Best Practices Implemented
1. ✅ Server-side secrets isolated from client code
2. ✅ Environment loading prioritizes server-specific files
3. ✅ Git ignores all environment files (preventing accidental commits)
4. ✅ Graceful error handling prevents data exposure through error messages
5. ✅ Authentication flow simplified to reduce confusion

## Next Steps (Recommended)
1. Rotate the exposed Stripe keys immediately in Stripe dashboard
2. Enable webhook signature verification in production
3. Add environment variable validation on server startup
4. Consider using a secrets management service for production
5. Add monitoring for failed authentication attempts
