- Assess business impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Estimate effort for improvements (hours/days/weeks)
- Link technical issues to user experience and revenue impact
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations with code references

**DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 pages) - Platform readiness, critical issues, strategic recommendations
2. **Technical Deep-Dive** (20-30 pages) - Component analysis with code references
3. **Business Intelligence Report** (10-15 pages) - Revenue opportunities, market positioning
4. **User Experience Analysis** (15-20 pages) - Journey optimization, conversion psychology
5. **Integration Status Report** (10-15 pages) - System health, security, scalability

**CULTURAL CONTEXT**: Remember this serves Brazilian athletes and scouts. Consider mobile-first usage, data plan constraints, Portuguese language nuances, and football culture throughout your analysis.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Your documentation should enable both the CTO and CEO to make confident strategic decisions about resource allocation and platform development priorities.

**BEGIN ANALYSIS**: Deploy all four sub-agents using the Task tool to conduct simultaneous analysis of different platform aspects. Each agent should use Read, Glob, Grep, and other tools to gather comprehensive data before reporting findings.
