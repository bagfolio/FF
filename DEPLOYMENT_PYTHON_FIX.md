# Python/Node-gyp Deployment Fix Implementation

## Issues Addressed

✅ **Python installation missing causing node-gyp to fail when building libpq native dependency**
- Added Python3, GCC, and build tools as system dependencies
- Created `.npmrc` configuration for Python path
- Updated pre-build script to configure Python environment

✅ **Application server not starting on port 5000 preventing connection**
- Port configuration already handled in existing setup
- Environment variables properly configured

✅ **Build command failing due to Python dependency required by node-gyp for native module compilation**
- Enhanced pre-build script with Python path detection
- Added npm configuration for native compilation
- Created deployment fix script for manual execution

## Applied Fixes

### 1. System Dependencies Added
```bash
# Added via packager tool
python3
gcc  
gnumake
```

### 2. NPM Configuration (.npmrc)
```
python=python3
target_platform=linux
target_arch=x64
cache_lock_stale=60000
node_gyp_cache_lock_stale=60000
```

### 3. Enhanced Pre-build Script
- Automatic Python path detection
- NPM configuration for native compilation
- Error handling for missing dependencies
- Environment variable setup

### 4. Build Server Updates
- Added external modules for problematic native dependencies
- Excluded `node-gyp` and `libpq` from bundling

### 5. Deployment Fix Script
Created `deploy-fix.sh` for manual execution during deployment:
- Sets Python environment variables
- Configures NPM for native compilation
- Verifies required tools are available

## How It Works

1. **Pre-build Phase**: Script detects Python3 installation and configures environment
2. **Build Phase**: Native modules compile using system Python
3. **Deployment Phase**: Environment variables ensure consistent compilation

## Verification

To verify the fix works:
```bash
# Run the deployment fix script
./deploy-fix.sh

# Check Python configuration
python3 --version
which python3

# Verify npm configuration
npm config get python
npm config get target_platform
```

## Environment Variables Set

- `PYTHON`: Path to Python3 executable
- `npm_config_python`: NPM-specific Python path
- `PYTHON_PATH`: Additional Python path reference
