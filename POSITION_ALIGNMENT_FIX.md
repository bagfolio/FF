### 2. **Improved Mobile Responsiveness**

#### Jersey Sizing:
```tsx
// Before: Fixed size
className="relative w-20 h-20"

// After: Responsive sizing
className="relative w-16 h-16 sm:w-20 sm:h-20"
```

#### Touch Target:
- Added `touch-target` class to ensure minimum 44px touch area on mobile
- CSS class defined in index.css ensures accessibility standards

#### Jersey Number:
```tsx
// Before: Fixed text size
className="text-white font-bebas text-2xl"

// After: Responsive text
className="text-white font-bebas text-xl sm:text-2xl"
```

#### Shadow Sizing:
```tsx
// Before: Fixed shadow

// After: Responsive shadow
className="w-12 h-2 sm:w-14 sm:h-3"
```

#### Container Padding:
```tsx
// Before: Fixed padding
className="px-8"

```

### 3. **Key Improvements**

1. **Proper Field Alignment**: All positions now properly spaced from field edges
   - Wing players have 5 units buffer from sidelines
   - Striker moved back from edge for realistic positioning

2. **Mobile Experience**: 
   - Smaller jerseys on mobile (64x64px instead of 80x80px)
   - Responsive text and shadow sizes
   - Maintained minimum touch targets for accessibility

3. **Visual Balance**:
   - Players appear properly distributed across the field
   - No positions touching or overlapping field boundaries
   - Natural football formation spacing

## Testing

Created `test-positions-updated.html` to verify position alignments with visual guides:
- Red lines show old edge positions (x:20, x:80)
- Green lines show new edge positions (x:25, x:75)
- All positions verified to be within field boundaries

## Result

The position selection screen now:
- Shows all players properly positioned within field boundaries
- Scales appropriately on mobile devices
- Maintains accessibility standards with proper touch targets
- Provides a realistic 4-3-3 formation layout
