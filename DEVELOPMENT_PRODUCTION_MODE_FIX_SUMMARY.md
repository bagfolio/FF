# Development/Production Mode Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Vite Excluded from Production Bundle**
- Added `vite` and related plugins to external modules list in `scripts/build-server.js`
- This prevents Vite code from being bundled into the production server

### 2. **Production Dependencies Cleaned**
- Modified `scripts/post-build.js` to filter out development-only dependencies
- Vite and related plugins are no longer included in `dist/package.json`
- Reduces production bundle size and eliminates unnecessary dependencies

### 3. **Dynamic Vite Imports**
- Changed `server/index.ts` to dynamically import `setupVite` only in development
- Moved Vite-specific imports inside the `setupVite` function in `server/vite.ts`
- Prevents Vite modules from being loaded in production

### 4. **Production Startup Script**
- Created `scripts/start-production.sh` to ensure NODE_ENV is set correctly
- Updated `.replit` deployment run command to use the startup script
- Guarantees NODE_ENV=production is set before the server starts

### 5. **Environment Detection**
- NODE_ENV is now set at the very beginning of `server/loadEnv.ts`
- Defaults to 'production' if not set (safer for deployments)
- Consistent environment detection throughout the application

## Results

- Production build no longer includes Vite dependencies
- Server correctly identifies production mode without confusion
- No attempt to load Vite modules in production
- Smaller production bundle size
- Clear separation between development and production behaviors

## Verification

After deployment, the server should:
1. Start with `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Serve static files from `dist/public`
3. Not attempt to load Vite
4. Not include Vite in node_modules
5. Show "ðŸ“¦ Running in production mode - serving static files" in logs
