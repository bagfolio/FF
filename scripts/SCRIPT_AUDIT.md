# Script Audit Results

## Scripts to KEEP:
- `build-server-simple.js` - Main server bundler using esbuild with 'external' packages strategy
- `post-build.js` - Creates production package.json and copies dependencies for deployment
- `pre-build.js` - Validates environment variables before build process
- `validate-deployment.js` - Post-build validation to ensure deployment readiness

## Scripts to DELETE:
- `build-server.js` - Duplicate of build-server-simple with slightly different config
- `build-deploy.js` - Just calls other scripts in sequence, redundant wrapper
- `simple-build.js` - Unknown purpose, appears to be experimental/redundant
- `quick-build.js` - Unknown purpose, appears to be experimental/redundant
- `pre-build-bypass.js` - Dangerous script that bypasses validation checks
- `deploy-ready.js` - Unclear purpose, seems to duplicate validate-deployment
- `create-simple-build.js` - Creates other scripts dynamically, not needed

## Final Build Pipeline:
1. `pre-build.js` - Environment validation
2. `vite build` - Client bundling
3. `build-server.js` - Server bundling (renamed from build-server-simple.js)
4. `post-build.js` - Production setup
5. `validate-deployment.js` - Final validation
