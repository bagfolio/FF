🔍 Current Issues Identified

Trust Level is Buried - "PRATA" badge is small and doesn't communicate value

Missing Conversion Trigger - No clear path to upgrade
Poor Mobile Density - Too much competing information
Generic Profile Photo Treatment - Doesn't build trust or personality

📱 Specific Feedback & Solutions
1. Trust Level Communication (CRITICAL)
Current: Small grey "PRATA" badge
Recommendation: Make this the star of the show
Instead of: [⭐ PRATA]

Use: 🥈 NÍVEL PRATA
     "2 passos para atrair mais scouts"
     [Progress bar: ████████░░] 80% para OURO
Why: Brazilian users respond to progress indicators and aspirational messaging. The trust level should feel like an achievement system, not just a label.
2. Hero Stats Prioritization
Current: Three equal stats (70%, 70 views, 3 tests)
Recommendation: Lead with the most compelling verified metric
Primary (Large): 
💎 2.76s SPRINT 20M
"Melhor que 90% dos atletas" ← This should be HUGE

Secondary (Smaller):
👁️ 70 visualizações • 🏆 #12 São Luís
Why: Lead with your strongest verified data point. The percentile ranking is more impressive than raw view counts.
3. Profile Photo Strategy
Current: Empty placeholder circle
Recommendation: Smart placeholder with action prompt
For empty state:
📸 [Camera icon in circle]
   "Adicionar foto aumenta 
    visualizações em 40%"
   [Adicionar Foto]

For completed:
[Photo with verification badge overlay]
✅ Verificado
Why: Turn the empty state into a conversion opportunity, and add trust signals to completed photos.
4. Mobile-Optimized Layout
Current: Horizontal stats layout
Recommendation: Vertical stack for mobile with clear hierarchy
Mobile Layout:
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 🥈 PRATA • Progresso││
│ ████████░░ 80% OURO ││  ← Primary focus
├─────────────────────┤
│ LUCAS FERREIRA      ││
│ Meio-campo • 16 anos││
├─────────────────────┤
│ 💎 TOP 10% VELOCIDADE││  ← Hero metric
│ 👁️ 70 views • 🏆 #12 ││  ← Supporting stats
└─────────────────────┘
5. Add Conversion Trigger
Missing: No upgrade prompt in hero section
Recommendation: Subtle but present upgrade hint
🥈 PRATA • [Desbloquear Platina →]
"Verificação por IA = 3x mais scouts"
Why: Plant the conversion seed early, especially since this user has 3 verified tests already.

Keep: Clean, minimal approach
