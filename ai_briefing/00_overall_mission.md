# MISSION BRIEFING: Project Futebol Futuro

**Objective:** Internalize this document. It is the philosophical "Why" behind all technical instructions.

**Our Core Purpose:** We are not just a data platform. We are a **dream factory**. We find undiscovered football talent in Brazil and give them a legitimate, merit-based path to a professional career. We fight against nepotism and luck with a single weapon: **verifiable data**.

**The User "João":** Our primary user is a 16-year-old athlete. He is passionate and skilled, but feels invisible. He lives on his mobile phone. He is motivated by progress, status, and seeing a clear path forward. He is demotivated by confusion, complexity, and ambiguity.

**The "Golden Path" User Journey:** The entire platform is designed to guide João along this path:
1.  **Onboard:** Complete his profile.
2.  **Act:** Perform a `Combine Digital` test.
3.  **Verify:** Get his results verified by our (simulated for now) AI.
4.  **Level Up:** Climb the `Pirâmide da Confiança`.
5.  **Get Noticed:** See his profile views from scouts increase.

Every screen, especially the dashboard, must be an engine to move him to the next step on this Golden Path.
